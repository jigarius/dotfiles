# Jigarius: Dot files

I've finally found the time and courage to share my dot files. This will
surely help me the next time I'm helping someone configure their shell.

If you find something that I should not be sharing with the public, please
let me know and I'll remove it. Thanks.

## Clibato

[Clibato](https://pypi.org/project/clibato/) is Python app that I wrote to
help me with my dot file backups. Feel free to try Clibato and let me know
if you have any feedback.
